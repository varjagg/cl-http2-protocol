;; Port notes: We cannot subclass STRING in CL to accomplish what we
;; want. We have less utility methods out-of-the-box, so we'll define a
;; bunch of methods similar to the Ruby String ones. We start with some
;; vector primitives, and then define the BUFFER class, which will have
;; a slot carrying the actual binary data.
